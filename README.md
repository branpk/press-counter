Simple app that shows an A press counter and changes color while A is being held down.
I threw this together for my SM64 RTABC runs since there was no good alternative at the time,
but it's definitely lacking in functionality and customizability.

The advantage to using a separate program instead of a ROM hack is that it tracks A presses
across game resets. The main disadvantage is that it only works for emulator runs.
